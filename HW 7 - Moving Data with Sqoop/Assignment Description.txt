For this exercise, you will use the following two files: CustomerDetails.txt and LatePayments.txt. Perform the following operations:

1. Log in to MySQL, create the database, and insert the records into the two tables of this database.
2. Verify that both tables are created correctly and contain records.
3. Load the data from these two tables into HDFS using the Sqoop import command.
4. Using Hive, create a similar database and create and populate both tables.
5. Perform the following:
a. Display customers (ID, name, year of birth, and zip code) from the state of New York.
b. Display the total number of customers who have late payments for each zip code.
c. Display the customers who have any late transactions and the date of each late transaction for the customers born before 1985.
d. Display the cities and the number of customers who do not have a credit card for each city, sorted by the number of customers.
e. Display the states and the number of customers who have late payments and use mobile banking in each state.
f. Display all customers who do not have a mobile phone.
g. Display all customers who have late payments and the number of late payments, sorted by the number of late payments.
h. Display customers (ID, name, city, state) who have no late payments and the total number of on-time payments. Order the output by the number of on-time payments.
i. Display customers (ID, name, city, state) who have no late payments and use the Internet for banking.
6. Store the results of the following query in HDFS:
a. Display all customers who have late payments and the number of late payments, sorted by the number of late payments.
7. Move the results of the query in #6 above from HDFS into the bank_db database in MySQL using the Sqoop export command.
8. Perform a select all to verify that the results were exported correctly.
